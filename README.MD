- Miami Tetris (static)
- This is the static version of Miami tetris. The other version is the same game but served with a node server.
- Of this version, here are two branches, one with a index.php file and a home.html to deploy with heroku, and the other branch set up to deploy with github pages.
The github pages branch has no index.php file and it has an index.html file instead of a home.html file.
